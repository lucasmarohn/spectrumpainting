				"The crew was great and their attention to detail was impressive. Doug was professional and committed to satisfying our needs. His lead painter Bernie exhibited a high level of expertise and he and his crew did a great job of cleaning up every day. Their attention to detail and customer satisfaction is greatly appreciated. I highly recommend Spectrum Painting."

				<h3>Exterior Painting</h3>

				<p>SPECTRUM Painting has many years of experience painting single family residential homes and multi-family complexes. We use the term “Gold Plating” for our work on exteriors because that is what we do.</p>

				<p>Because of our superior preparation and paint, our exteriors last longer than a typical paint job. We also do commercial shopping centers and small business storefronts. From Arroyo Grande to Solvang, we have painted many beautiful, multi color, business store fronts, golf course community homes and large lot custom home exteriors.</p>

		<h3>What should I do to prepare for the estimate?</h3>

		<div>

			<p>

			It’s best for all descision makers to be present at the time of the estimate. If not, make sure you discuss all work ahead of time.<br />

			We recommend that you:

			<ul>

				<li>Make a list of all the work you want done for each room or on the exterior of your home.</li>

				<li>Make a list of what you did and did not like about your last paint job or painter.</li>

				<li>Identify your budget. We realize that painting your home is a major investment. We want to earn your business and can tailor a proposal for every budget.</li>
